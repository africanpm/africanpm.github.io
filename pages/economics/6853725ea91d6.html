                African politicians and their rhetoric during electioneering season can amaze people who are not familiar with the process. If one is not conversant with the process, they might think phrases like "I will do this; I will build that" during and after elections will be from their pockets or are done as a kind gesture.

                Globally, the act of governance serves as a medium to enact policy and allocate public resources. Government primary responsibility is to provide security, welfare, and social amenities, stimulate the economy, and promote political activities. Thus, building projects covered in the capital budget is part and parcel of government responsibility and hence, cannot be used as political achievements or favour done to citizens.

                <b>Infrastructural Development in Africa:</b> Infrastructure serves as the yardstick to measure the development index of a country. To rank favourably in the developmental index, political leaders usually budget a chunk of the annual budget towards Capital/Infrastructural Developments. A capital budget is a plan for acquisition of capital assets, with lifetime expectancy extending beyond the acquisition year. A capital budget reflects the value of time and usually has distinctive funding sources, such as bonds. These funding sources are necessary for long-term projects, like roads, bridges, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Africa ranks top in infrastructural deficit, and may continue towards this trajectory if urgent measures are not in place to remedy the situation. Corruption easily tops the chart as the culprit for underdevelopment of Africa. Therefore, we must interrogate the role of political leaders and that of the citizens that enable this menace. Political participation is crucial to grasp the inner workings of governance, what the citizen should expect from their leaders and how to hold leaders accountable. Trading blames every time things go wrong gets nothing done, actions without consequences embolden corruption. 
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s worthy to note that corruption is not limited to Africa. Corruption is a global phenomenon only that Africa tends not to punish political leaders who brazenly engage in the act. Guess the law is meant only for the poor and not for the elites. <br />

    <strong>Infrastructural Deficit in Africa:</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        Africa is grappling with various degrees of infrastructural decadency ranging from road networks, housing, transportation, potable water, and electrification, down to the health and education sector. It is pertinent to note that Africa has made a tremendous stride in human and capital development, yet it is not Uhuru. Interestingly, most African leaders, sees infrastructure as a favour to their fellow citizens; and should be applauded for carrying out their constitutional responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        While we clamour for rapid infrastructural development across Africa, there is need to examine the process as project execution in most African countries is fraught with corruption. For example, overpriced projects are almost the norm in Nigeria and other African countries, and the process of awarding most of these contracts is riddle with controversy.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point, Africans must start questioning process their political leaders award contracts viz-a-viz global best practices. Hence, promote accountability instead of celebrating over bloated infrastructure if they want to reverse this ugly trend.

                    Infrastructure is the key to sustainable development for any nation serious with positive development indexing. Citizens must pay attention to both fiscal and monetary policy rolled out by the government. African leaders cannot be said to be ignorant of what good infrastructure looks like or its benefits. They travel out of the continent, observe how the developed countries function, and interestingly for medical tourism; thus, leaving Africa underdeveloped is a deliberate act and must be condemned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Poor infrastructure has its toll, one being the massive brain drain due to migration of young skilled workers to developed countries for a better life across Africa. The big question that remained unanswered to those migrating is who will fix this problem?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Obviously, running or distancing has never solved any real problem. Historically, host country gets tired of the continued influence of migrants and the proverbial sayings <b>"the chicken will come home to roost"</b> becomes stack reality. Thus, good governance and accountability goes pari passu, until Africa starts demanding accountability from their political leaders; good governance will remain an illusion.

    <summary>THE TWIST:</summary>
    <p>
        In Africa, government functionaries are eulogized for doing their job. Basically Africans think their politicians do them a favour by constructing roads, building hospitals/schools, paying salaries, grants, etc. that one begins to wonder what they think political office holders were elected to do or should be doing constitutionally.
