THE IMPLICATIONS OF FOOD INSECURITY
Overviews: 
The recent Russian invasion of Ukraine spiked food insecurity all over the world. It is estimated that about 832 million people around the world suffers from a lack of adequate and healthy food regularly. 
Food insecurity is not synonymous with Africa, it is a global problem. The opposite of food insecurity is food security which is the measure of the availability of food and an individual’s ability to access it. Hence food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs or preferences for an active and healthy life (United Nations); While, food insecurity exists when people do not have adequate physical, social or economic access to food.
Factor that Contributes to African Food Insecurity:
Climate change is likely to intensify food insecurity across Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan region. This coupled with Russia’s war in Ukraine and COVID-19 pandemic shutting global economies pits Africa more than likely to face unprecedented food shortages, thus driving inflation up. With the looming recession on major economies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that many countries could default on debt repayment and this spells doom to poorer nations as windows for bailout funds to maintain adequate food supplies might be cut off.
The need for food security cannot be overemphasised; political or economic instability that comes with food insecurity is better imagined for any government. A good example to highlight the plights political leaders face once recession bites, will be the economic decisions of former British Prime Minister, Liz Truss. Her decision to rule out windfall tax triggered economic summersault and eventually, cost her seat.
Impact of Food Insecurity:
The link between food insecurity and peace cannot be overemphasised in any political discourse. There has always been a thin line between peace and conflict; all that is required for this line to be broken is a little provocation, and hell will be let lose. For instance, most of the wars in the Horn of Africa can be attributed to disagreements between the government of the day that is backed by West and Islamic extremist who wants to introduce Sharia-Laws in every facets of their constitution. All it took is for one party to clamp down on the others ideology to erode the fragile peace.
Conflict leads to food insecurity and food insecurity in turn aggravates conflict. Conflicts have destructive and long-term negative on both political and economic outlook of any region; it leaves on its trail political instability and poverty. 
Poverty creates a perfect recruitment tool for insurgents; the promise of good food to hungry kids is more than enough guise to recruit young boys and girls; thus creating boundless human resources for their sustained activities. Groups like Al-Shabaab, Boko-Haram, and ISWAP are not ignorant of these tactics.
Hence, it is necessary to have sustainable interventions that enhance resilience to conflicts, whilst ensuring sustainable development in Africa.

THE TWIST:
Food insecurity can change the political and economic dynamics of any country, it has the potency to bring government to its knees and force regime change. Oddly this rule doesn’t apply to African leadership; they have made poverty a political weapon, used to suppress their people. Since food insecurity leads to migration, African leaders simply waits for foreign aids which they never accounted for anyways, since it’s very hard to get accurate data on “Food Inflation Index”. If the aid stops, they allow migration, invariably, making it a problem for the West and other continent.
Agriculture as Antidote to Food Insecurity: 
Food is a product of agricultural activities, thus farmers' welfare should be prioritised. Though giant strides have been made towards achieving sustainable agriculture via government interventions; for example the “Anchor Borrowers Programme” in Nigeria, where the Central Bank stepped in to assist farmers, but is always riddled with problems. One of the notable problems of these sorts of interventions is that, it’s hardly seen except on papers. With a simple browse on the internet, you will be flooded with various programmes, running into billions of dollars spent on agriculture alone, yet food insecurity persists. No significant progress has been made towards the mechanisation or storage of products when harvested. Storage is a key component when it comes to boosting food security; it minimises post-harvest loss, hence; ensuring sustainable and cost-effective products in the market. 
The region has a long way to go in terms of harnessing the power of agriculture for sustainable food security. This cannot end with the leaders just telling citizens to go back to agriculture; they should also convey a clear plan from planting, harvesting, and processing down to the last value chain consumption. It is worthy of note that open grazing is still a thing in Africa. Livestock is a form of farming but when herd animals start eating farmers’ crops, it’s a perfect recipe for disaster. Therefore, it should be part of leadership’s goal to develop a blueprint where farm animals are prevented from destroying farmlands, as this can be counterproductive or even lead to farms-herders conflicts, which is also counterproductive in the campaign for food security for the region.

In Conclusion:
The spike of terrorism rocking Africa, especially Sub-Saharan region contributes to food insecurity. Achieving food security should be a top priority of the regional; unfortunately, that is not the case. For instance, Nigeria has an acronym “Stomach Infrastructure” that connotes the use of hunger to induce voters. Hunger has been weaponised to an extent politicians sees it as an opportunity to display affection during electioneering season. This ugly trend may suggest that ending poverty and making food affordable is not in sight; instead, it has become a lacuna which politicians capitalise to score cheap political points.
To move Africa forward, agriculture and its processes must be transformed to become more resilient and deliver cost-effective, cum affordable produce for all, sustainably and inclusively.
