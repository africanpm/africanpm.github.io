POVERTY: THE REAL CHANGE CATALYST TO UNDERDEVELOPMENT.
Poverty is not peculiar to Africa; the West (Europe) they idolised today for their industrial strides did not wake up to paved roads, electricity or social amenities. To understand how Africans can take advantage of poverty ravaging its people, it is important to study Europe's economy and how the West were able to use poverty as a catalyst that subsequently paved the way for an industrial revolution. Industrial Revolution, which is termed the process of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing. These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally transformed society. This process began in Britain in the 18th century and from there spread to other parts of the world. Although used earlier by French writers, the term Industrial Revolution was first popularized by the English economic historian Arnold Toynbee (1852–83) to describe Britain’s economic development from 1760 to 1840.
It is not rocket science for Africa to tackle poverty, yet it has proven a herculean task for drivers of African economies to navigate these murky waters. African leaders clamoured for independence, arguing they are politically mature to govern themselves and stop economic sabotage that only develop Europe and left behind poverty across Africa. Decades after independence, Africa remains underdeveloped and the West still have access to raw materials which are now being handled by Africans themselves.
Development amidst Poverty:
Poverty and development are two sides to a coin figuratively; they presuppose and challenge one another. Generally, in the West, it is the manifestation of poverty, constraints, disease or accidents that propels it to progress. This is the story behind inventions and technology. In Africa though, poverty is a hindrance to progress. Lack of infrastructure, deep-seated corruption practices, various forms of conflict, bad governance and poor health facilities cannot promote a healthy population committed to working for progress and development. Crudely, every person is unto himself/herself. As pessimistic as this picture may be, all is not lost. Africa can still be a developed continent. It is this belief that motivates the reflection of this discourse.
Poor implementation of the policy has always been a problem in Africa, 70% of religion in Africa is borrowed but do we see the originators of these religious practices leaving their civic responsibilities to the Gods? It’s surreal that the majority of Africans especially the poor masses think development is God-given and can only happen at God’s appointed time. None of the developed nations was handed development on a platter of gold; it is rather a gradual process of economic transformation and must not necessarily happen in unionism. This explains why some areas, such as China and India, did not begin their first industrial revolutions until the 20th century, while others, such as the United States and Western Europe, began undergoing “second” industrial revolutions by the late 19th century.
Granted, poverty in Africa can be attributed to external influence and unequal trade relations in the international market. These can no longer suffix as an excuse; this has been a problem since time immemorial, thus, African leaders should grab the bull by the horn and chart her political and economic road map.
#THE TWIST:
 Africa and Asia are at the lower ladder in terms of development but funny enough they hold the two important key ingredients for development (Natural and Human Resources). Ironically, the harsh economic condition that prompted the West to industrialise, only encourage Africa to seek Foreign Aid.
Industrial Revolution:
The Industrial Revolution, which began roughly in the second half of the 1700s and stretched into the early 1800s, was a period of enormous change in Europe and America. The invention of new technologies, from mechanized looms for weaving cloth and the steam-powered locomotive to improvements in iron smelting, transformed what had been largely rural societies of farmers and craftsmen who made goods by hand. Many people moved from the countryside into fast-growing cities, where they worked in factories filled with machinery.
 
While the Industrial Revolution created economic growth and offered new opportunities, that progress came with significant downsides, from damage to the environment and health and safety hazards to squalid living conditions for workers and their families. Historians say that many of these problems persisted and grew in the Second Industrial Revolution, another period of rapid change that began in the late 1800s.
The main features involved in the Industrial Revolution were technological, socioeconomic, and cultural.
Africa and the need for Industrial Revolution:
Historically, Africa holds no vital position in international politics but takes centre stage once aid is discussed. International aid has never translated to development; It’s on record that no nation attains Developed status through foreign aid.
Poverty is not only a lack of money to take care of the basic necessity of life it creates a picture of aimlessness, uncertainty and hopelessness at the extreme in the mind of the poor. Where there is no infrastructure and services, people will lack pipe-borne water supplies, sewage connections or adequate toilet facilities, garbage collection and basic measures to prevent disease and provide health care. Such deficiencies promote diarrhoea, dysenteries, typhoid, intestinal parasites and food poisoning and not development. When combined with malnutrition, these can so weaken the body's defence system and measles, pneumonia and other common childhood diseases become major killers (Cairncross, 1990).
In Conclusion: 
Continually exporting once comparative advantage only to turn and complain that you need the same material to compete makes no sense. Just like Europe and America are in alliance, Africa and Asia might consider a meagre to boost their reach on the global stage.
In the industrialised world, any form of deficiency is considered a challenge to progress but in African countries, there is a symbiotic relationship between development and poverty. Poverty does not seem to adequately challenge the Africans to embark on the road to industrialization and progress. Poverty is in Africa and without development, citizens may not be able to compete with others because of a lack of necessary capital, the technical-know-how and expertise. Symbiotically, without development poverty may not be eradicated. The solution to the dilemmatic situation in the continent is to confront the reality of poverty and challenges of development simultaneously, nationally and internationally.
While Africa is encouraged to industrialise, it is pertinent to note the negatives such as pollution, global warming, child labour etc. that come with it. With appropriate measures, these impacts can be nipped in the bud.
