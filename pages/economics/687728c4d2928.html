                Economy is the life-line of any given society on which every other activities thrive. Putting this into perceptive, it simply means every society must strive to better its lot economically or perish. Hence, economy can be seen as a system by which a society organizes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Ultimately, it determines how resources are allocated and how value is assigned to things within a society, which invariably is the goal of politics.

                Africa like the rest of the world started out with Hunter-Gatherer economic outlook. They progressed to agro-based economy and eventually established relatively successful trade pattern (Trade by Batter). These transitions progressed smoothly until the advent of the European explorers. Early European explorers whom later turned colonizers significantly exploited the African economy through various means, including forced labor, resource extraction, and the imposition of trade systems that favored European interests. These actions led to economic stagnation and underdevelopment in many African regions.

            <h4>Early Explorations</h4>

            <p>
                Though the dubious mean employed by these explorers can be said to be draconian, unfortunately they don’t African economic development but their respective motherlands. Early exploration where heavily funded by the states and they expect return on their investment. If Africans failed to read the thin line between the kind gestures they fronted before taking foot hold of their resources, exploitation is inevitable.

                Economic exploitation is not unique to Africa; almost all the continent witnessed it in one form or the other. Over the years, other continents have regained major control of their resources except for Africa whom have not made a significant economic impact on the global stage.

    <strong>Economic exploitation</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        Economy simply burdens itself with production, distribution and consumption. It’s important to understand this basic concept as it this knowledge that draws the thin-line of being the explorer or the exploited. Economic exploitation can be referred to as the unfair or unjust use of a person or group's labour or resources for profit, often involving power imbalances and unequal exchange. Obviously, Europeans are better off at this point because they have industrialised and are better off with resource management. It is simply their comparative advantage to set the tone for trade, routes, labour, resources, finance, etc. whatever they do with these powers is subject for another discuss. Thus, this is the essence of economic development which is often profit driven for any nation. Africa on the hand majorly consists of hunters and farms with little or no knowledge of how to utilize all the natural resource it has, for any industrial action.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s important to clarify that Europeans is not sole penetrators of this dastard act, as exploitation can manifest in various forms, including exploitative labour practices, financial abuse, and the exploitation of resources through wars and other means. The only difference is that some major European powers did it on massive scale, while Africa as a result of low technological advancement limited theirs within their regions, often their neighbours being the victim.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the years, it has been argued that African leaders’ hands were tied in respect to negotiations and series of events that lead to their. It is pertinent to note that their political, church and village leaders somewhat benefited from these exploitation. Their wards received the best of western education, gets to travel to West and have access to the good things of live while their people wallow in abject poverty.

        <h4>Major European Players in African Economic Sabotage</h4>

        <span>
            When it comes to the scramble and partitioning of Africa, it’s not all the European countries we have today participated. Some did participate but lost their colonials as result of some historical events like WW2 where German and Italy lost their colonies. We will beam light on the major powers that be at that time to benefit greatly from Africa woes.
        </span>

        <li>
            <b>France:</b> France focused on extracting resources like timber and minerals from its vast African colonies, often through concessionary companies that were granted monopolies over resource extraction. 
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Britain:</b> Britain established a system of indirect rule in many of its colonies, using local chiefs to enforce colonial policies and extract resources. Britain also heavily invested in infrastructure to support trade and resource extraction. 
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Portugal:</b> Portugal's colonial rule in Africa was characterized by the prazo system, which involved granting land to Portuguese settlers who often married into African royal families to legitimize their rule. Portugal also relied heavily on forced labor and was known for its brutality in its colonies.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Belgium:</b> Under King Leopold II, the Congo Free State became notorious for its brutal exploitation of rubber resources, with forced labor and violence being widespread. 
        </li>

        <span>
            Unfortunately, the consequences of these exploitative practices were severe, leading to long-term economic stagnation, social disruption, and the underdevelopment of many African nations.

        <strong>In conclusion:</strong>

                    The exploitation of African economies by colonial powers had long-lasting consequences, contributing to poverty, inequality, and underdevelopment that persist in many African countries today. The artificial borders imposed during the colonial era also contributed to ethnic and political tensions that continue to plague the continent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    European colonial powers like France, Britain, Portugal, and Belgium significantly exploited African economies through resource extraction, forced labor, and the imposition of trade policies that favored European interests. This exploitation involved various methods, including the slave trade, the establishment of colonial administrations, and the imposition of economic systems that prioritized European needs over African development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, it’s time for African leaders to take up the mantle of leadership and right these wrongs. It is not the duty of European or their foreign diplomats to negotiate favourable trade policy for the continent. The onus lies with them, only if they can forfeit the freebies that come with sabotaging their own economy.

    <summary>THE TWIST</summary>
    <p>
        The illusion of instant wealth that comes with the sale of one’s natural resources, will always blind visionless leaders to the impending economic doom that goes hand-in-hand when scarcity sets in.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alas, he who controls the means of production (resources); controls the economic prosperity of the nation.
