                Africans where economically exploited in phases which can be broken down into direct and indirect exploitations. The 1st which is the direct-exploitation was carried out by be early European explorers (Colonial Maters) and later which is the indirect exploitation is a result bad economic and political alliance of her political leaders. It can be argued that African doesn’t know any better when the 1st happen, but the later can debated or contested by various school of taught.

                Invariable seeking clarity as to why Africa was colonized and subsequently exploited to the extent that she nearly lost her identity and traditional means of production is quiet an enormous task. Hence, it is best to assume their primitive nature played an integral part to the illogical trade negotiation recorded at that point in time. Unfortunately, history seems to always repeat itself as the same lopsided agreements are being signed by African leaders not only to the Europeans, but to the Americans and Asian Giants.

            <h4>The Importance of Exploitation in any Economy:</h4>

            <p>
                Though it can be argued that exploitation in any form is evil, but it is not inherently bad in the broader perspective. Religiously, it can be seen as being evil/bad but economies does function on the morality principle. In economics, the emphasis is means of production and how its gotten can viewed good to those that acquired it and evil to those whom it’s taken from. Simply put, always find a way to be the taker, for as long the basic principle of economics (supply and demand) remains true, resources must be taken either peacefully or violently.
            </p>

            <p>
                Understanding how wars and its means of production via arms and ammunition equals power projection, which ultimately leads to favourable economic negotiation (Trade agreement) is the primary reason why America got favourable deals and subsequently independence from the British Empire. Simply put, it is the monopoly of violence that led to success of colonialism. Unfortunately, Africa is yet to capitalize and liberate themselves from the heavy reliance on the USA and Russia for arming her forces. This pattern of behavior give credence to the school of thoughts that believed Africans were never exploited, perhaps they have too many greed-driven leaders whom negotiated their economic trades based on personal gains; instead of the overall good for the continent.

    <strong>The Economic Woes</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        Every struggle economy has telltale sign which is not but limited to:  Resource Extraction, Forced Labor, Trade Imbalance, Land Grabs, Monoculture, Suppression of Indigenous Industries, Financial Exploitation, Infrastructure Development, etc. This stated signs can lead to overreliance which boosts the perpetrators GDP mainly the US, China and Russia’s economic and strategic gain, often at the expense of African nations' development and sovereignty. While it can be said that each nation is old enough to negotiate her economic policies, unfortunately, illogical deals by most African political leaders can lead to debt burdens, resource extraction, and the potential undermining of democracy.

            Unlike the Asians and Americas whom witnessed the same level of exploitation by the European explorers (Colonial Masters), Africa is yet to find its footing when it comes to trade negotiation which is the bedrock of economic development/advancement. Gradually, the means of production is predominately residing with the Asian Tigers, whilst Africa not excluding the Giant of Africa (Nigeria) is still the hub for exportation natural resources.

                    Only the weak nations preach peace, whilst the strong takes the means of their production. You can export violence and make gains off of selling weapons via military industrial complex. America talks and champions global peace initiatives yet are the highest in terms of military spending and sales global. Therefore, Africa must learn to adopt or perish for it’s not the duty of your advisories to equip one with knowledge but to zero in on your ignorance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, the increasing debt levels of many African nations, particularly those owed to China, raise concerns about debt sustainability and potential economic instability. The exploitation of natural resources can exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to a "resource curse," where a country's wealth in natural resources does not translate into broad-based development. Lastly, the growing influence of external powers can undermine the sovereignty of African nations and their ability to make independent decisions.

    <summary>THE TWIST</summary>
    <p>
        Africa is blessed with the resources and favourable climate for year-round production on an industrial scale to boost her economic relevance on the global stage; but seems to be toeing the line of import-dependency, which is a perfect recipe for economic disaster. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, the constant recycling of bad leaders whose interest is to siphon resources for personal aggrandizement will remain the bane of her self-inflicted economic sabotage.
