                  Africa has experienced pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial economy/political eras and it can be argued that most of her political and economic policies are wildly shaped by these experience. Historically, Africa has enjoyed independence and some form of monarchical system of governance before colonization. Thus, colonialism eroded most of the cultural heritage of Africans; hence, Africa is a mirage of their colonial master’s form of governance but in reality practices a governance system that merely suits their colonizers. Unfortunately, this ugly trend is vivid from her political structure, military formations, education, religion, official languages, international policies, etc. which at best is directly copied and largely tuned to favour her colonial/pay-masters hence, birthing neo-colonialism.

            <p>
                  <b>What is Governance?</b> Primarily, governance is a system or process by which an organisation is controlled and operates, and the mechanisms by which it, and its people, are held to account. Governance derives its legitimacy from the law, thus for there to be a government, it means that the society has to submit its rights to a certain authority to oversee its affairs. 
                  Government can come in different forms, below are classical examples:
            </p>

            <p>
                  <b>Democracy:</b> Simply put, it is the government of the people, by the people, and for the people. It is a government in which rules are drafted by the people; either directly or through elected representatives. As the poster boy of what modern government should look like, it is pertinent to say the democratic system of government believes in political freedom and equity (“Spirit of Democracy”). The Western (America and its allies) spearheads this form of governance; fortunately, African countries tend to lean towards democracy except for some Northern African countries (largely controlled by the Arabic laws), the rest toed the line of democracy just like Western powers.
            </p>

            <p>
                  <b>Theocracy:</b> This form of government drives legitimacy from religious doctrine; it is a government under the control of a state-sponsored religion. Religion played a significant role in the colonization, especially that of Africa as it makes it easier to stripe the intended colony of traditional heritage/identity and once a particular set of people loses their identity it’s easy to erase or replace their political history. Dating way back 18 centuries, Romans understand the importance of religion and used Christianity as a unifying force to colonize the world, and Muhammad in a similar fashion used Islam to suppress and bring the Middle East under his control. Unequivocally, Religion has proven to be a great tool of governance in the right hands. And if wisely used, the government can function with fewer glitches as people tend to have an instinct not to offend or go against God. Arabian countries tend to spearhead this form of governance and Islam remains the only dominant religion that indoctrinates its laws (Sharia) into government.
            </p>

            <p>
                  <b>Autocracy:</b> Autocracy bequeaths infinite/unlimited power to a single individual. Contemporary politics tend to frown at this system of government as it implies a dictatorial system whereby an individual has high jack power and tends to take decisions without the input of fellow citizens. Dictators favour this system as it affords them the luxury of lording over their decision on the state. They want every political and economic decision to go their way and can deploy maximum force just to achieve their selfish desires. Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Idia Amin, etc. are prime examples of leaders who have gone down memory lane as dictators.
            </p>

            <p>
                  <b>Socialism/Communism:</b> Figuratively, these systems of governance have one common goal that involves taking control of means production by the state; by implication, it promotes social and economic equality in which there is no capitalism. While Socialism tends to harness state resources and allocate them collectively; Communism on the other hand creates a socialist society where classes, money, and the state no longer exist. It is not uncommon to see these systems digress as much power is placed in the hands of few, who in turn draft policies that stifle individual entrepreneurial spirits, hence right violation is common. Russia, North Korea, and China are an example of communist nations and their leaders are slowly but progressively inching towards dictatorship thus, the popular saying “absolute power corrupts absolutely”. Recent activities of these leaders ranging from missile launching, political interference, and annexation of their neighbouring countries are undemocratic and more autocratic.

    <strong>What is the way forward:</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
      Democracy largely has not worked in Africa, and it's time Africa braces their political reality and understands that copy and paste system of government cannot profit her in the long run. Democracy in other cline promotes nationalism and patriotism; that is largely it has worked positively for Western power politically and economically. The famous quote from a renowned American president “Don’t look for what America will do for you but what you will do for America (Abraham Lincoln)” sounds good for democratic government, but sadly it cannot work in Africa. Colonial masters brought people of different cultures and beliefs into one colony for their ease of administration and it worked for them. The result of this action is the loss true nationalist spirit of Africans because of cultural differences. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, Nigeria adopted the American bicameral system of federalism but in reality, this system cannot work with the religious polarisation of the Muslim-dominated north and Christian-dominated south. These have led to constant panel beating of the constitution until it is almost unitary in nature. Cameroon and Uganda exemplify autocratic regimes where leaders have been in power for over three decades and clamp down on opposition to ensure their continuous stay in office while masquerading as democrats to the international community. It is safe to say African political turmoil boils down to ethnoreligious conflict; Africa wants to take back her identity outside the fetish nationalism imposed on them by imperial masters, proving that ultimately people of opposing beliefs should not be bounded no matter the circumstance.

                  It has become a matter of urgency for Africa through regional blocks; to develop a system that will work for her. This journey might be futile owing to the sharp divide (French vs. British colony) that colonialism left in Africa; it’s still worth a try “journey of a thousand miles, starts with a step”.

                <p>
                  Prominent African men and women (Nelson Mandela, Julius Nyerere, Nnamdi Azikwe, Robert Mugabe, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, Kwame Nkrumah, Obafemi Awolowo, Hastings Banda, etc.) wrote their names on the sands of time, they contributed immensely to the liberation of Africa from the imperialism. It is now left for current leaders to rise above ethnicity in the spirit of Pan-Africanism, whilst embracing their differences to attain a workable political policy that ensures Africa commands respect among nations, else continuous political upheaval pitting Africans against each other (Terrorism, Famer/Herdsmen clash, Military Coup, etc.) will impede her political and economic growth.

    <summary>THE TWIST:</summary>
    <p>
      Africa has not witnessed major political evolution, hence its penchant for Autocracy and Theocracy. The ruling class opts for Autocracy but uses Theocracy to keep their subject from revolts; turns around fronting a glossy picture of Democracy to the international communities, to ensure steady supplies of free money in the guise of foreign aid.
