PARTY POLITICS IN AFRICA
Overview: Politics, as we know it today, have evolved over the years with numerous innovations and alterations made. Pre-colonial Africa does not engage in party politics, this concept was popularised with the advent of democracy. Britain and America remain the Mecca of party politics. Their political development is so good that citizens can firsthand tell what national politics is to be pursued once a party assumes government.
Party politics evolved as a means to curtail the excess of the political class, thereby ensuring politicians strictly adhere to the policies and principles of a political party irrespective of public or personal interest. Political Parties are important aspect of democratic as well as autocratic political system of government, though the democratic system of government usually has more than one political party, as opposed to autocracy which mainly governs through a single-party system.
The phenomenon of Political Party
      Politics, especially democracy is meant to have a winner-loser party in every election. Without proper organization, the electioneering business can quickly get out of control as no one easily accepts defeat. A political party is more than an election platform for contestants; it also serves as a tool for political orientation. This role suits it very well as only people of seeming political outlook form a party, thereby eliminating the age-long rival between people of opposing views (Far-right and Far-left). 
You cannot rid politics of opposing ideologies; these opposing notions generally translate to far-right and far-left. 
The far-left wing is characterised by an emphasis on “ideas such as freedom, equality, fraternity, rights, progress, reform, and internationalism” Whilst The Far-Right Wing is characterised by an emphasis on “notions such as authority, hierarchy, order, duty, tradition, reaction, and nationalism”. 
Thus, party politicking is a unique form of politics conducted through, by, or for parties, as opposed to other interests or the public good
THE TWIST: Party politics was introduced to rally like minds to garner enough support to secure elective positions; democracy as we know it, essentially is a game of numbers. Unfortunately, African Politicians generally think of winning elections and retaining power, they don’t care much about party ideology or structure with defined political and economic projection. 
Way Forward 
Africa is yet to reach maturity in contemporary politics; clearly, Africa remains the only continent with less known imperial adventures. Imperialism provided the needed learning curves for advanced democracies; they remained the last continent to rid itself of colonialism. It’s tough to have a strong political grip on governance with recorded years of colonial rule. Ethiopia being the only African country that was not colonized suffers the same abysmal failure in terms of party politics.
Having a workable and pre-defined political ideology cannot be overemphasized in Africa, it seems all her policies are imported or copied from their respective colonial masters. It is difficult to point to a particular political goal developed and implemented locally or internationally solely by Africa without input from the West, monetarily and otherwise. Africa seems to lack political ideologies and the over-reliance on the Western powers for green light remains a stumbling block towards developing strong political parties that can think or act independently.
Summary 
There is no clear-cut policy for political parties in Africa, each promising a change of status quo only to end up maintaining the status quo once in power. Politics has taken a dangerous turn of do-or-die affairs, we can only count a handful of leaders that have willingly handed over after the completion of the term or when defeated at the poll. The lack of party ideology or goals, have made politics in Africa generally a winner takes all; hence, everybody is jostling to take power and loot as much as he/she can since there is no clearly defined political or economic path. 
Had it been party-politics lived up to its mandate, this ideology would have been spelt and any candidate that wants to contest under any political platform must abide by the laid down rules. It is very common to see cross-carpeting, switching of sides as soon as the party primary election is lost, or promising what is not in the party manifesto just to get votes. It has always been the end that justifies the means for these politicians.
