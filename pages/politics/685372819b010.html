                Political system is closely structured to replicate societal norms but at a larger scale. Just like the society, politics is structured on either patriarchy or matriarchy system with some key difference. While the society sees patriarchal system as men being the head of family and women playing supportive roles at home; politics goes way beyond that. In politics, it extends to the entire society where men dominate in all social, political, economical, legal and cultural roles. Women were confined to domestic chores and completely cut off from the realities of governance. A prime example patriarchal system of governance is the Victorian era, where women were considered as delicate, fragile, and ignorant beings. The matriarchy system functions just like patriarchy only with reverse role, women dominated. The Mosuo culture of China is a prime example; women are the head of the household, next inline via inheritance and dominate the economic activities.

                Religion is another factor to be considered for this scenario, Christianity and Islam which are the two dominant, placed patriarch way above matriarch. Had it been the world stocked with theocracy, feminism and feminists would have been another case of illuminati, which exists only in the dark.

            <h4>WOMEN INVOLVEMENT IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS</h4>

            <p>
                Though political echelon is dominated by men and women seemly relegated to appointee positions, it is still subject to change based on which gender dominated the socio-cultural leadership. Politics is a power-play arena; thus, survival of the fittest naturally takes its course. Until the advent of democratic system of government, human rights and other constitutional rights we enjoy today weren’t in existence. At the early stage of human evolution, life was short and brute as a result of constant wars and competition for scarce resources. Political negotiations then were left for the warriors; leadership is by raw power and suppression. This art is not gender-based; there are female warriors too, for e.g. the Amazon queens were the elected rulers, warriors and hunters as well for their people.
            </p>

            <p>
                The world is slowly moving away from patriarchal system of government. It has evolved from autocracy and oligarchy; accompanied with various economic reforms. The most popular of them is capitalism, which leans towards democracy unlike socialism or communism that is the favourite of authoritarian regimes; to a hybrid system where merits and competence is the yard stick to assume leadership position, except in Arabian nations (Middle East). They are theocratic; hence, women are limited in accordance to Islamic dictates.
            </p>

            <h4>WOMAN PARTICIPATION IN AFRICAN POLITICS:</h4>

            <p>
                Women’s empowerment advocates in Africa are making their voices heard, with the full backing of international organisations such as the United Nations and the African Union. In the fight for gender equality, women around the world have advanced; yet its progress seems to be foot-dragging for African women.
                Significant progress can be seen in the appointment of women in key ministerial positions. There are 30% more women ministers of defence, 52.9% more women ministers of finance, and 13.6% more women ministers of foreign affairs. This is a sharp contrast to the “soft issue” portfolios, such as social affairs, children and family. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of women seated in parliament grew in 2018, with a regional average share of 23.7%, according to the 2019 edition of the biennial “Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Map of Women in Politics”.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hence, Africa needs to maintain this momentum, more women in politics lead to more inclusive decisions, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka UN Women Executive Director and former Deputy President of South Africa, states: “We still have a steep road ahead, but the growing proportion of women ministers is encouraging, especially where we see a rise in the number of countries with gender-balanced ministerial cabinets”. Globally and especially Moslem-controlled states still have discriminatory laws that limit women’s ability to run for political offices. As countries strive to implement Sustainable Development Goal 5, “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,” governments must also strive to embed gender parity in constitutions and legal frameworks; eliminate all forms of violence against women and ensure that women, like men, receive a quality education.

    <strong>WOMEN VIZ A VIZ POLITICS:</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        Africa has made a significant stride towards allowing women to participate actively in politics, unlike the Middle East where women are generally repressed. Women’s equal participation and leadership in political and public life are essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. However, data show that women are under-represented at all levels of decision-making worldwide and that achieving gender parity in political life is far off.
    </p>

    <p>
        As of 19 September 2022, there are 28 countries where 30 women serve as Heads of State and/or Government. At the current rate, gender equality in the highest positions of power will not be reached for another 130 years. Just 13 countries have a woman Head of State, and 15 countries have a woman Head of Government. Only 21 per cent of government ministers were women, with only 14 countries having achieved 50 per cent or more women in cabinets. With an annual increase of just 0.52 percentage points, gender parity in ministerial positions will not be achieved before 2077.
    </p>

    <p>
        Globally, there are 24 States in which women account for less than 10 per cent of parliamentarians in single or lower houses, including three single/lower chambers with no women at all.
    </p>

    <h4>Prominent Women Leaders that have impacted the World</h4>

    <ul class="artice_bullet_list">
        The likes of Angela Merkels, Dilma Rousseffs, Helen Clark , Mary Schapiro, Theresa May, Hanan Ashrawi, Viviane Reding, Valentina Matviyenko, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Cecilia Malmstrom, Lubna Al-Qasimi, Atifete Jahjaga, Ann Dunwoody, Marisela Morales, Theresa May, Mary Schapiro, Valerie Amos, etc., are notable women whom have impacted the world politically, economically and otherwise in their respective career span. We also have women of calibre in Africa that contributed locally and internationally towards political and economic advancement just like their Americans, Europeans and Asian counterparts:

        <li>
            <b>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala:</b> former World Bank Managing Director and Nigeria Finance Minister; currently the director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Fatou Bensouda:</b> former Minister of Justice and Attorney General in Gambia. She is the second chief prosecutor of International Criminal Court (ICC), she will oversee cases against the likes of Ivory Coast’s Laurent Gbagbo, Sudan’s Omar Hassan al-Bashir, and the fugitive Lord’s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony, in the course of her nine-year term.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Fayza Abul Naga:</b> served as Mubarak’s chief negotiator in the long battles with U.S. diplomats over how much control Cairo could have in disbursing billions of dollars in U.S. aid. Years after the revolution (Arab Spring), she still presses Egypt’s new military rulers to prosecute 19 American NGO workers, whom allegedly are the “foreign hands” leading the country astray. The crisis put the $1.5 billion in annual U.S. aid to Egypt at risk, but Abul Naga has refused to back down, insisting that Egypt could do without U.S. assistance.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Lindiwe Mazibuko:</b> at 31, became the party’s first black parliamentary caucus leader in the opposition Democratic Alliance party, considered pro-apartheid in South Africa’s politics until her emergency.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <strong>To Summarise:</strong>

        <div>

                <p class="article_first_para">
                    Politics should be an instrument for human advancement in terms of policy and not to suppress women. Most of the gender-based violence we campaign against is the spill-over of years men were allowed solely to make political and economic decision that affects women directly or indirectly. People, irrespective of gender, tribe, or religion should partake in decision-making which governs their lives. Balanced political participation and power-sharing cum decision-making is the internationally agreed target set in the Beijing Declaration; most countries in the world have not achieved gender balance. Only a handful have set or met ambitious targets for gender parity (50–50).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Power is transit, a world where men dominate all spheres of political and economic planning is not ideal. There should be a balance of power so as not to tip the world balance towards masculinity. A good example of women's leadership prowess is seen in families. Family is a mirror of the larger society and women’s efficiency in managing this micro unit cannot be overlooked; hence, feminine touches in policy formulation are very important.

    <summary>THE TWIST:</summary>
    <p>
        Let’s do away with the taught that women are more lenient with power than men; power intoxication is no respecter of gender. Women have held political offices (Margret Tasha, Angela Markel, Ellen J Sirleaf, etc.), become Monarchs (Queen Elizabeth II) and lead the economic sector (Jane Fraser, Nandita Bakhshi, Cecilia Ibru, etc.), yet corruption rate did not decline. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The only reason women are not on the spotlight for power abuse, is their relatively smaller ratio compared to men. A quick peak in history will tell a better story, and yes absolute power corrupts irrespective of gender.
