                Politics in Africa is not for the fainthearted, the concentration of power on the central authority made heads of state untouchable and unaccountable; thus, the demise of democratic tenet. Leveraging this lacuna, powerful elites capitalised and made it their sole responsibility to influence who becomes the head of political affairs, hence, the birth of political “Godfatherism” across board. Therefore, to be a godfather, one must be influential enough to install a stooge while he/she seats back and control things behind the scene. This nefarious practice is vivid in Nigeria, where ‘godfathers’ determines who wins elections, government contracts or access to the country’s oil wealth.

                <b>Politics of Godfatherism:</b> Africa at default tilts towards the tradition of elders being at the helm of political and economic decision-making. Elders are seen as better custodians, hence they have entrusted the power of decision that governs societies. This worked before modernization; however clever political opportunists found a way to smuggle this ideology into modern politics in the guise of laws limiting age brackets which one must attain before vying for any political office. With this aberration, African political settings became saturated with aged men and women who have refused to relinquish power or embrace innovation, because they fear a change of status quo.

                Contemporarily, there is no justification for this charade of staying in power for 30+ years by most African Presidents or Heads of State (they view the political office as a throne, thereby indirectly becoming a king instead of a government official), 70% of them came to power in their 30s and early 40s. These unholy romances of power have over the years bred leaders who have refused to cede power. They employ all forms of tactics to ensure their grip on power, to the detriment of rule of law.

    <strong>Impact of Godfathers on African Politics:</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        Take Nigeria aside, political godfathers are less popular in other African countries. But their political leaders are more likely to turn demi-gods, often conducting sham elections with infinite office terms. This is often done with the help of their former colonial masters, whose interest is to access and continuously exploit their natural resources. To understand this phenomenon, Nigeria’s political landscape becomes our focal point. Not all aspirants to a political office can win in an election, thus, godfathers steps in with their enormous resources which are necessary to survive the violent and corrupt political system. Successful candidates are often those who are “sponsored” by wealthy and powerful individuals (political godfathers).
    </p>

    <p>
        These godfathers are not mere financiers of political campaigns. Rather they are individuals whose power stems not just from wealth but from their ability to deploy violence and corruption to manipulate national, state or local government election in support of the politicians they sponsor. In return, they demand a substantial degree of control over the governments they help bring into power. This should not be mistaken for a good desire to shape government policy, but to exact direct financial “returns” by allocating government resources to themselves in the guise of grants or being awarded lucrative government contracts by their protégés.
    </p>

    <p>
        In some cases godfathers are the public officials themselves, using their access to public funds to sponsor lower-level officials. A good insight into how this works can be seen in this statement: “Money flows up and down… these honourable members (of the Oyo State House of Assembly), during the election period, they want the patronage of the puppeteer. Afterwards, money will flow in the opposite direction—back from the puppet to the puppeteer. ” credited to H.E Victor Olunloyo, former governor of Oyo State.

                    Godfatherism simply put, is a form of political corruption in which an influential individual handpicks a less popular candidate, to attain leadership position, thereby giving he or she undue advanmtage to exert authority or influence through the backdoor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Across Africa, godfathers are the major cause of politically induecd violence and corruption that plagues and hampered political/economic growth. Officials who owe their success to the effort of any political godfather, has indirectly incurred a debt that must be repaid throughout their tenure. The ability of these powerful figures to deploy violence during electioneering seasons made them indispensible, for it is not uncommon to hear of political assassination of popular or opposing candidates. They can out-rightly rig the election to favour the candidates they support irrespective of whom the electorates voted at the poll.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, Africans should not expect good governance anytime soon, if they allow godfatherism to fester in her political system. They simply cannot afford to keep doing things the same old ways and be expecting new results. Change they say is constant and it ought to start first with politics if they hope to turn things around for good.

    <summary>THE TWIST:</summary>
    <p>
         Often than necessary, Africans are quick to point accusing fingers at the whites, thinking colonialism is the sole reason they are backward; yet years after independence, no African leader has changed the narrative or practised true democracy like they wanted the whites to give them. Ironically, they embraced neo-colonialism for the easy money it guarantees (Foreign Aid), like their forefathers before slavery and subsequent colonialism. 
         African political godfathers, milk Africa of her resources the same way Europeans did during colonial era to develop their region economically. But the case of these godfathers are different, instead of using the proceeds to empower and develop their region economically; they moved it offshore, thereby accomplishing the aim of colonialism without the input of colonial masters. History they say keeps repeating itself.
