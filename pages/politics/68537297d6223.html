                Nigeria, a previously unitary state under British monarch, became a federation in 1954 with the merger of three geo-political regions, reflecting the three largest ethnic groups the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo. These ethnic groups dominated the then Northern, Western and Eastern Regions respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nigeria made up of more than 200 ethnic groups with different cultures, languages, beliefs, and ideologies; is in endear need of a political system that will cater for its diversity, hence, the adoption of a federal system of government. In other to understand why Nigeria’s founding fathers chose this system of government, we must first look at the definition of federalism which is a state in which both the central government and the constituent governments rule over the same territory and people and each has the authority to make some decisions independently of the other’ (Riker, 1964). Thus, Nigeria modelled United States of America’s federal system of government, with Northern, Western and Eastern Region as federating units respectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                This arraignment was jettisoned by Gen. Ironsi’s led administration for a unitary form of government, after the failed 1966 coup led by Maj. Chukwu K. Nzeogwu. Power was concentrated at the centre for military ease of administration at the detriment of regional independence, thus hampering their decision-making and policy formulation. Over the years, Nigeria tried reverting to status quo; however, constant military interventions and the benefit a particular section of the country drives from the unitary form of government makes it impossible, thus, marking the end of true federalism.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Nigeria’s Returns to Federalism:</b> Like every other thing Nigeria does in reverse mode, federalism returned in unitary clothing after the military handed over government to the fourth civilian government in 1999. Going down memory lane to understand why Nigeria is not practising true federalism is crucial in understanding why Nigeria’s federating units go cap-in-hand to the central unit every month for budgetary allocations, and why over the years, they produced political billionaires who cannot explain their source of wealth.
            </p>

            <p>
                The annulment of the 1993 presidential election, believed to have been won by MKO Abiola can be said to be the catalyst for the renewed agitation, for true federalism in Nigeria. With the June 12th annulment, Nigerian people saw the danger of over-concentration of power at the centre. This move further heightened suspicions and metamorphosed into different regions demanding drastic changes in the economic and political policies, except the Northern Region. The North unlike other geo-political zones wants the status quo maintained. This development did not come as a surprise to the Southern Regions because, the federal character principle, being the majority at the federal level and quota system, tends to favour the North.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hence, Northern Nigeria controls the federal government (central government) as the majority at the National Assembly and gets appointed to sensitive offices with minimal qualification, thanks to the federal character principle. They also have an undue advantage over the south in the military, para-military, schools, and any other commission owned by the federal government irrespective of meeting the required benchmark or not. The South on the other hand was divided in their clamours and without a common uniting force their success rate at changing any of these policies were at best abysmal, while religion played an integral part in the north, uniting them under the Fulani-dominated emirate.

    <strong>Northern/Southern Political Dycotomy </strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        The Yoruba’s seems to be better off in the Southern block politically; they can unite and pursue a common course for their region. A prime example is when the Yoruba-dominated South-West argued that the 1993 annulment robbed them their chance at the central government and that North were not willing to concede political power to the South. Their continuous pressure led to all the regions accepting to allow only South-West candidates contest in the build up of fourth republic, hence, the emergence of Olusegun Obasanjo as the president in 1999. Again, the merger between Tunibu (South-West) and Buhari (North-West) that took power from PDP in 2015; demonstrated their ability to collaborate with any region to advance their course, thus, giving the South-West Vice-Presidential slot at the federal level.
    </p>

    <p>
        South-East on the hand has been complaining of marginalisation and lack of federal projects in their region, but fails to build formidable political alliance with any region in order to advance their course. These agitations led to the formation of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). This group clamoured for secession, citing the lack of federal presence since the end of the civil war in 1970. Unfortunately, only political charged reasons such as denial to participate in governance or being ruled by other regions could trigger extreme measures to end political alliance such as Nigeria.
    </p>

    <p>
        South-South agitation is majorly economically driven; they are the hen that lays the gold egg, while the Core-North is the majority at the central government taking the lion’s share. Their agitation is simple; give us access to our natural resources, as it is done in every federal system of government, so we can develop our region while contributing our quota for the running of the federal government. Like the South-East, they resorted to militancy to derive home their point. However, the emergency of Goodluck Jonathan as the Vice-President in 2007 and subsequently, the President in 2011 quietened the tension. President Goodluck did not grant them resource control despite coming from the region; he infamously barred the possibility of separation which would have been the alternative if resource control did not work, during the 2014 national conference. The fact that Nigeria state gives oil producing states 13 percent derivations from the sales of the crude oil to supplement their normal revenue allocations, has made this agitation weak.

    <strong>Genesis of the Nigerian Political turmoil:</strong>

    <p class="article_first_para">
        Nigeria started with true federalism, until military in their infinite wisdom decided to intervene; unfortunately, military rule and democratic tenets do not mix. Military interventions are not limited to Nigeria; almost all the African countries in the sixties were grappling with coup-de-tats. Military intervention is still a problem in African politics, the recent being the overthrow of democratically elected government in Burkina Faso (30 September 2022), again truncating democracy and rule of law. Like other African countries where people of opposing cultures were lumped together by their colonial masters, Nigerians finds it difficult to have a common national identity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Achilles heel of this checky union between ethnic groups is the unification of the North and Southern protectorates, nothing but trouble has come out of it since British colonialists left a hundred-plus years ago. The discrepancy in the modus operandi of these regions sparked agitations, subsequently leading to the secession of the Igbo’s dominated (Old Eastern) region that was met with fiase suppression from the central government (North-dominated); thus, igniting the 1967 civil war. In 1970, the war ended with Eastern region (Biafra) surrendering to the Nigerian state, ending the civil war but not the underlining problem that sparked it.
    </p>

    <h4>What is the way out?</h4>

    <p> 
        Nigeria's problem is man-made and can only be corrected with the right policy and national integration that can only be achieved through federalism. The idea to force people to believe they are one when their cultural and religious differences are glaring is wrong. The world must understand that dark skin only, is not a criterion to map Africa as one entity; they should be allowed to sort out their differences.
        
        <ul class="artice_bullet_list">
            The world must accept that North and South are not the same, contrary to what politicians want their people and the international communities to believe. There are many “maybes” and “ifs” that could have changed the cause of history and corrected the 1914 amalgamation, thus:
            
            <li> 
                If Zik of Africa had allowed the planned Northern secession in 1953, the Biafra’s war may have not been fought;
            </li>
            <li>
                If Gen. Aguiyi-Ironsi had left the regional government independent, instead of concentrating power at the centre, Nigeria might still have True Federalism;
            </li>
            <li> 
                If the “One Nigeria” slogan that has become a stumbling block, to the discussion of “True Federalism” was not re-echoed by Gen. Gowon from the North-Central region, The farmer-herders clash, that has seen Fulani herders having a field day killing farmers and sacking villages might be avoided;
            </li>
            <li> 
                And above all, just maybe President Goodluck Jonathan from South-South did not explicitly bar the discussion of national unity, in the 2014 National Conference; maybe Nigerians might be having round table meetings negotiating their national unity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Hence, at any point in time Nigerians wonders why their federal system works in reverse order, they might want to look inwards, their region’s actions or inactions might be the answer.

        <strong>Conclusion:</strong>

        <div>
            <img id="article_subcover" src="" alt="photo">

                <p class="article_first_para">
                    Politics is a game of numbers and democracy favours the majority. Since the majority carries the vote, hence, the concept of comparative advantage in democratic settings became imperative. Taking these into consideration and applying it to Nigeria, it became obvious that every geo-political zone has one form of comparative advantage or the other. The census currently in use scored the North higher than the South. The accuracy of this figure has been argued but the reality on the ground is that the North boosts more state and local government than their Southern counterpart, hence more allocation at the federal level, even though the resources flows from the South.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is important to note that every region irrespective of the lopsided sharing formula has their comparative advantages. For instance, Southern Nigeria excels in business/academics while the North is good in politics. Unfortunately, this can pose a little problem as will be seen in the following analysis: For education and businesses to thrive in the South, there must be enabling policies; and for the North to maintain its political dominance, they need businesses and education to lift their region out of poverty. These murky waters could have been easily navigated with mutual benefits, except for intolerance, especially that of religion, the big elephant in the room.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As simple as religious intolerance may sound, it is a serious business in Nigerian politics. Out here, competence is often sacrificed along ethnic/religious lines. For example, it will be very difficult to elect a Christian politician at the helm of affairs in the Muslim-dominated north-west; likewise, that of a Muslim in the Christian-dominated south-east. These are some of the telltale signs that without “True Federalism”, where each region controls their resources and develop at its own pace, it is only but a matter of time before another civil unrest erupts.

    <summary>THE TWIST:</summary>
    <p>
        Irrespective of how various ethnic groups in Nigeria want to change the Unitary-clothed, Federalism structure currently practised, they must first understand where the problem preventing true federalism stems. It is easy to complain but every region has a representative at the national assembly, granted, certain regions dominate via simple majority. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If your representative is okay with the way things are done, and no concerted effort is made to elect who you believe will change the narrative, “True Federalism” will always mean different things to different regions in Nigeria; though its definition is simple, straightforward and clear.
