                Justice which is referred to as fairness and righteousness in its most basic sense, is crucial for the effective dispensation of law and order. Justice can be broadly defined, but for this concept it will be narrowed down to it political applications. Politics is essential in establishing the norms of any given society; in Africa, democracy takes the main frame. To understand how politics and justice intertwined, it’s important to understand how democracy truly works. Democracy preaches delegation of power between executive, legislatures and the judiciary; with each independent, in respect of their duties and at the same time act as each other’s checks and balances.

                <b>The Blur Line:</b>
                 Though democracy clearly split/delegate powers, there is a lot of politicking that goes under the hood between the major arms of government when it comes to appointing or electing their respective leaders can be mucky. Justice as a concept involves upholding what is morally right, ensuring that individuals receive what is due to them, and holding people accountable for their actions. However, politicians unfortunately are not the caliber of people to entrust the dispensation of justice into their hands, hence democracy as governance concept tries to make its 3rd arm (Judiciary) apolitical. Thus the idea of Judge(s) been appointed by the executives which is deemed too political should be viewed by people of good conscience as the big elephant in the room that enables miscarriage of justice.

    <strong>Justice System in Africa</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        <i><q>Judiciary is last hope of the common</q></i> sound good and hopefully until one finds him/herself at the mercy of overtly politicized court of law. It is as if the judicial officials in this part of the world which is the primary constituency of the judiciary arm of government has perfected a way to manipulate justice againts the common man. It is not uncommon for the poor to be on awaiting trial for donkey years whilst the rich/politicians are speedily tried and given bail-able conditions which indirectly translate to walking free from justice. They usually employ delay tactics to stall the trials till almost people loss interest or the poorer party runs out of procescution fees.
    </p>

    <p>
        In most of the African countries for example Nigeria, justice typically goes to the highest bidder or the most powerful in the society. It is difficult to get favorable judgment if one is not a man/woman of means. This miscarriage of justice extends to every sapphire of the society and politicians especially those in oppossion are not exempted. It is practically impossible for opposition party to get justice or favorable judgment against the incumbent cause of the way the justice system is designed. It is unethical for the incumbent to appoint and fire judges in the apex courts which is meant to checkmate their excesses. This setup is nothing but a disaster waiting to happen.
    </p>

    <strong>Justice through other means:</strong>

    <p>
        Time changes and so do the people, unlike the millennial (Generation Y), the current crops of African youths majorly Gen-Z (Generation Z) tends to want things done differently which the corrupt politicians are finding difficult to contain. The era of cheap lies are over, all thanks to the availability of information at the palms of the youths powered by the internet (social media) and the use of brute-force employed by the rogue leaders which cannot be masked easily as a result of active citizens journalism is largely frowned upon by the international communities; hence, political leaders are left with no choice but to turn towards their puppets (legislatures) or their judicial appointees to enact draconian laws for the same oppressive purposes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Africans largely depends on <abbr title="International Criminal Court">ICC</abbr>, <abbr title="Non-governmental organizations">NGOs</abbr> or Western Powers to help reign in their rogue leaders and hopefully bring them to justice. The Judicial Arm of government is nothing but cosmetic addition with the current setup just to answer democracy. It is difficult for African youths to trust their justice system and it makes it extremely difficult to believe their government can implement any meaningful change that will better their lots. It is easier to call the attention of the international community’s to their plights than to entertain the thought that a judge appointed by their Presidents or Governors can help to right the wrongs in the land which is the resultant effects of bad policies.

                    Justice in political dispensation is often associated with the legal system and the administration of laws. This includes the processes of courts, law enforcement, and other institutions that ensure laws are applied fairly and impartially. It also involves the concept of due process, ensuring that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case and are treated with dignity and respect. This case cannot be made for most African countries as their leaders never accept responsiblities interms injustice mated to their citizen. The 20 October 2020 case of Nigerian citizens protesting the brutality of the Police Forces were massacred by Military under the command of the then Nigerian President Gen. M. Buhari.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Kenyans are facing similar ordily in the hands of William Ruto, were police are ordered to shot protesters.
                    If Africans can truly see justice for its real intent, maybe her political and economic outlook might start looking bright. With current way things are done, it is practically impossible to see any form of laudable justice through the judiciary as they are currently in beds with corrupt politicians, lobbing for juicy appointments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All hope is not lost, and Africa can right her wrongs if they can take the bold step of untaggling the judiciary from the executive arm of government. For instance Kenya Supreme Court in 2017 ruled against the then President Uhuru Kenyatta, thereby nullifying his sham election and ordered a new poll within 60 days. This is the bold step needed by judicial system that free from the interference and manipulation of politicians to rid Africa of corruption and subsequently miscarriage of justice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Incidents like this gives hope to the common man that the judiciary might one day be their last hope, if only the executive government cease to influence who sits as the judge(s) at the apex court of law. In essence, justice is a multifaceted concept that encompasses fairness, morality, and the application of laws and principles to ensure that individuals and communities are treated with respect and equity.

    <summary>THE TWIST</summary>
    <p>
        In Africa, justice means different thing to different classes of people. Justice or judgement is usually reversed for the rich and the poor at the mercy of corrupt policing system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, the legal system is not designed to dispense justice; hence <b>“Justice”</b> simply put is but a name parents give their kids for the fun of it, in this part of the world.
