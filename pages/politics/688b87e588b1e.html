                Politically Africa is yet to reach its potential towards achieving food security which is essential for survival, irrespective of having the necessary tools theoretically. Political ranking/relevance of every country can be determined by two major factors: <b>Military</b> and <b>Economic</b> might. Power is never given but taken; thus, the more economic resources a country have the more the need for a strong military, than can deter external aggression. If they succeed at deterring external and internal aggression by implication securing their land and means of production, then it’s time to project power externally for favourable economic deal. This in a nutshell is the formular that has kept the United States of America, as the super power since the early 20th century. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Agriculture remained the primary tool the United States use to sustain the Allied Forces during the 1st and 2nd world war conquest, subsequently making their national currency <b><q><abbr title="United State Dollar">USD</abbr></q></b> the dominant currency for international trade. Their agricultural system is robust as a result of mechanization and good policies carefully designed towards security food. It can be argued that her economy was based off on the same agriculture during cotton trade boom; which unfortunately is embroiled in slavery before the gold bench mark. Therefore, agriculture is imperative for food sustainability of any country and must be given priority with necessary incentives.
            </p>

            <h4>Food Security as a Potent Political Tool</h4>

            <p>
                Technology as a tool can been leveraged towards achieving food sustainability, which in-turn boasts peoples confidents on their government. Every seasoned politician must be familiarized with this concept, as going against it will only spell doom. <b>Joseph Stalin</b> <i>(Soviet Union)</i> and <b>Mao Zedong</b> <i>(People Republic of China)</i> both prominent figure of communism, learnt in a hard way the implication of taking the means of production from individuals and placing them solely on one entity or government. Thus, a government policy that limits the farmers or the idea of taking the means of production off the capitalist hands is nothing but a deserter waiting to happen. Most African leaders seem not to be good students of history, they are skeptical in respect to achieving food security through investment in technology which is the new kid around the block. They rather live with the illusion that United Nations will always send food aids to cushion the effects of bad agricultural policies they blindly implement over the years, instead of hitting the rest button and toe the line of innovation like the rest of the world. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Hence, for Africa to be politically relevant in the grand scheme of things, she must first conquer hunger, which is like a giant mole preventing any significant impact she may wield in global politics. The lacuna between industrialization and the use of improved seedless when most African countries cannot preserve or process more that 37% of her farm produce on an average yearly, is what is fueling GMOs controversy and its place in achieving food security.

    <strong>Why Food Security Matters in Global Politics.</strong>
    <p class="article_first_para">
        The gap between third world and achieving food security is closing rapidly with advancement in technological breakthrough of the 21st century. In the game of politics, leverage matters and the developed countries exploit this gap to dump their excesses on the 3rd world as long as their leaders remain clueless or dumb enough to keep run to the West for aids, instead of embracing mechanized agriculture. Compared to powers like the USA, China or Russia, African countries are more like toddlers, hence their over-dependency on handout and constant bootlicking of the super powers for both economic and political protection. Every innovation is a tool for political or economic leverage; hence, the constant pressure for technological innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Developed countries heavily depend on data for better and accurate planning of economic policies. It is imperative to understand how technology has interwoven itself in the fabrics of modern day society, of which yearly production in terms of agricultural outputs is now possible. Food security is a hallmark of developing/developed nations, so if Africa is striving for political relevance they should take the necessary steps towards achieving food sustainability for the world to take her policies or inputs seriously.
    </p>

    <h4>Political Perspective of Over-reliance on Genetically Modified Crops</h4>

    <p>
        Agriculture remains the potent medium to achieving food security. And governance simply defined, primes itself with protection of life and properties of which food is an essential ingredient keeping us alive. One needs to be alive to enjoy dividends of good governance; thus, governments across the globe prioritise agriculture and subsidizing farmers to ensure steady supply of food. Advancement in technology made large scale farming possible through the invention of farming machineries and storage facilities. With these, plus proper irrigation channels; farming all year round is now visible. 
    </p>

    <p>
        With every innovation comes a down side, mechanised farming often leaves the soil dilapidated, thereby making crops yield less subsequent planting seasons. This low yielding problem of a result excessive farming, coupled with crop-bore-diseases prompted the development of GMOs. Genetically modified crops yields better and are resist to common pest/disease that hampers growth and bumper harvest. Unfortunately, technology comes at a cost and the country or company with the patent dictates the tone of its usage and set the profit margins in this current capitalist driven economy.
    </p>

    <h4>How does Africa fair in GMOs Politics?</h4>

    <p>
        Africa is at a cross road best described with the analogy of <b><q>between the devil and the deep blue sea</q></b>. The deep blue sea in this contest profiles Africa as a desperate nation, in dare need of food security for her teaming population; hence, they need <abbr title="Genetically Modified Organisms">GMOs</abbr> that is capable of high yields to achieve food sustainability, which if managed well with the existing technology (Mechanised farming and Storage facilitates) can lead to food surplus for the continent. Thereby providing the needed food security at the shortest possible time; but at the detriment of her local crops/market. 
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other hand, the devil in this contest can be viewed as the capitalist who deciphered a means to sterilize these crops/seedlings (GMOs), thereby becoming the sole distributor of the fertile variants. This implies that the food security of any nation that uses these steril GMOs are in the hands of the company or country with the patent for the fertile variant of these genetically modified seeds.

                <p class="article_first_para">
                    The prospect of achieving food security is too luring but one must weigh the consequences of every political decision, especially that which will affect the food security of a country, in other not to shoot one’s self on the foot. Morality is not a political currency, in these murky waters of power play among nations, leverage serves as a potent tool. Therefore, diplomats must be trained to understand the act of politicking, instead of photograph opportunity (Photo Op.) African leaders and diplomats usually prioritise over meaningful engagement on the global stage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    African diplomats must start figuring how to use their comparative advantage in policy negotiations. It is better to negotiate from point of advantage or exhaust ones options 1st before lashing on shinny freebies. Africa has never been the prime target of meaning development; hence, <b><i>all that glitters are not gold</i></b> should not only be a mare idioms but a watch word for African political leaders in this push for <abbr title="Genetically Modified Crops">GMOs</abbr> into her agricultural system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    History is bound to repeat itself and those unfortunate enough to be at the wrong side of it, might not be alive to tell the tale. Across Africa, the use of technology has not been standardized. Most of her political leaders are too skeptical to adopt modern innovations, rather preferring the old order, which gives them the room to manipulate policies as they dim fit.

    <summary>THE TWIST</summary>
    <p>
        Those who are conversant with politics are no stranger to the term <q>Beware of Greek gift</q> for nothing good/beneficial comes as freebies. Hence, it is the responsibilities of the Political Leaders to investigate the undertones prompting Bill Gate's kind gestures towards achieving food security and recent push to use genetically modified crops (<abbr title="Genetically Modified Organisms">GMOs</abbr>).
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, those who weaponise poverty and hunger should not act surprised when foreign donors starts dictating its governance policy.
